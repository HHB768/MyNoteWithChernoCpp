# MyNoteWithChernoCpp
I will update my notes according to ytb video series ChernoCpp

---
Note that I write them in a same project so I commented all the other files before I learned a new class.

* My style: learn from codes instead of plain words.
* Get started on _1_introduction.cpp.
* Add some comments in my blog collection: https://www.cnblogs.com/hhb768/collections/1520 (discarded)
* Environment: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
